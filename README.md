# BinaryTree Program

**Data Structure:**  Binary Tree <BR>
**Programming Focus:** C++ class development

## Overview

Welcome to the BinaryTree Program! This C++ program implements a binary tree using the provided `node.h` file. The program simulates a binary tree structure in the driver program found in the `binarytree.cc` file. This project is part of the Fall 2023 CSCI 340 - PE1 Data Struct Algorithm Analysis course, and it was completed by Jose Barron.

## Features

- **Binary Tree Implementation:**
  - Creates a binary tree using the provided `node.h` file.
  - Supports insertion of nodes into the tree.

- **Size and Height Calculation:**
  - Provides functions to calculate the size and height of the binary tree.

- **Inorder Traversal:**
  - Performs an inorder traversal of the binary tree, printing the data values of each node.

## Test Runs

The program has been tested with various scenarios to ensure its correct functionality and performance. The test cases include different sizes of vectors containing random integers and floats.

1. **Integer Binary Tree:**
   - Creates a binary tree with random integers.
   - Displays the size and height of the tree.
   - Prints the data values of nodes in inorder traversal.

2. **Float Binary Tree:**
   - Creates a binary tree with random floating-point numbers.
   - Displays the size and height of the tree.
   - Prints the data values of nodes in inorder traversal.

## Code Organization

All the code for this project is located in the accompanying files:

- `btree.h`: Header file defining the `BinaryTree` class and its member functions.
- `node.h` (given): Header file defining the `Node` class used in the binary tree.
- `binarytree.cc` (given): Main program file where the binary tree is created and tested.

## Skills Showcase

This project demonstrates proficiency in several key areas:

- **C++ Programming:**
  - Utilizes C++ language features, including templates and classes, to implement a binary tree data structure.

- **Data Structures:**
  - Implements a binary tree with dynamic node allocation.

- **Algorithm Analysis:**
  - Calculates the size and height of the binary tree efficiently.

- **Testing and Debugging:**
  - Conducts thorough testing to ensure correct functionality.
  - Handles different scenarios with random data.

- **Code Organization:**
  - Structured code into separate header and implementation files (`btree.h`, `node.h`, `binarytree.cc`).

These skills collectively showcase the ability to design, implement, and test a C++ program that effectively utilizes data structures and algorithms to solve a specific problem domain.
